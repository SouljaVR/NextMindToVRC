# NextMindToVRC
An alpha VRChat Mod that allows for the Next-Mind Brain Computer Interface to drive VRChat avatar parameters.

## Requirements:

- Next-Mind BCI Dev Kit (In theory this should work with the full release version too, though I dont have my hands on one to test that.)
- Windows 10 1902+
- [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net48)
- [Melonloader 5.x.x](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader)
- Competent Unity knowledge. Your avatar needs to be setup with the appropriate logic to take advantage of this mod. If you dont have a supported avatar, this mod will do absolutely nothing.

## Disclaimer

As with all VRChat mods, modifying the game client can result in account termination, be it temporary or permanent. While this mod doesn't ruin the experience for others, using it may still be a bannable offence.<br>

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**. I will not be held responsible for any punishments you may recieve for using this mod.
